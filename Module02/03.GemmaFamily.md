```

### Specialized Prompt Engineering

**For Multimodal Tasks:**
```python
def create_multimodal_prompt(text_query, image_description="", task_type="analysis"):
    """Create structured prompt for multimodal tasks"""
    
    if task_type == "analysis":
        system_msg = """You are Gemma, an AI assistant with advanced vision capabilities. 
        When analyzing images, provide detailed, accurate descriptions and insights.
        Structure your analysis with clear sections for visual elements, context, and implications."""
    
    elif task_type == "comparison":
        system_msg = """You are Gemma, an AI assistant specialized in visual comparison tasks.
        Compare images systematically, highlighting similarities, differences, and key insights.
        Organize your comparison with clear categories and specific observations."""

# Example usage for image analysis
analysis_prompt = create_multimodal_prompt(
    "Analyze this business chart and identify key trends, patterns, and actionable insights.",
    "This appears to be a quarterly revenue chart spanning 2 years",
    task_type="analysis"
)
```

**For Function Calling with Context:**
```python
def create_function_calling_prompt(user_query, available_functions, context=""):
    """Create structured prompt for function calling with Gemma 3"""
    
    function_descriptions = []
    for func in available_functions:

        if 'parameters' in func:
            params = ", ".join([f"{k} ({v.get('type', 'string')})" 
                              for k, v in func['parameters'].get('properties', {}).items()])
            func_desc += f"\n  Parameters: {params}"
        function_descriptions.append(func_desc)
    
    system_prompt = f"""You are Gemma, an AI assistant with access to specific functions.

Available Functions:
{chr(10).join(function_descriptions)}

When a user request requires function calls:
1. Identify which function(s) to use
2. Extract appropriate parameters from the user's request
3. Respond with function calls in this format:
   FUNCTION_CALL: function_name(param1="value1", param2="value2")

If multiple functions are needed, list them separately.
If no function is needed, respond normally.

{f"Context: {context}" if context else ""}"""

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_query}
    ]
    
    return messages

# Example function definitions
weather_functions = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather_forecast",
        "description": "Get weather forecast for a specific location and time period",

            }
        }
    }
]

# Create function calling prompt
user_request = "I'm traveling to Tokyo next week. Can you check the 5-day weather forecast and any severe weather warnings?"
prompt = create_function_calling_prompt(user_request, weather_functions)
```

### Multilingual Applications with Cultural Context

```python
def create_culturally_aware_prompt(query, target_cultures, response_style="formal"):

    Cultural Considerations:
    {chr(10).join(cultural_notes)}
    
    Provide your response in the requested languages with cultural appropriateness."""

    messages = [

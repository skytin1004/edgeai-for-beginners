### High-Performance Code Generation

BitNET demonstrates strong coding capabilities while maintaining efficiency:

```bash
User: Write a Python function to implement a binary search algorithm with proper error handling.

BitNET Response: Here's a robust binary search implementation with comprehensive error handling:
```

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a sorted array.
    
    Args:
        arr (list): Sorted list of comparable elements
        target: Element to search for
        
    Returns:
        int: Index of target if found, -1 if not found
        
    Raises:
        TypeError: If arr is not a list
        ValueError: If arr is empty or not sorted
    """
    # Input validation
    if not isinstance(arr, list):
        raise TypeError("Array must be a list")
    
    if len(arr) == 0:
        raise ValueError("Array cannot be empty")
    
    # Check if array is sorted
    if not all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):
        raise ValueError("Array must be sorted")
    
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        try:
            if arr[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif arr[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        except (IndexError, TypeError) as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Error during comparison: {e}")
    
    return -1

# Example usage with error handling
try:
    result = binary_search([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], 7)
    print(f"Found at index: {result}")
except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```


### Mathematical Reasoning Example

BitNET models demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning capabilities:

```bash
User: Solve this optimization problem: A company wants to minimize costs while maximizing profit. They have a budget of $10,000 for marketing and production. Marketing costs $50 per campaign and yields $200 profit per campaign. Production costs $100 per unit and yields $150 profit per unit. What's the optimal allocation?

BitNET Response: I'll solve this linear programming optimization problem step by step.


**Problem Setup:**
- Budget constraint: $10,000
- Marketing: Cost $50/campaign, Profit $200/campaign → Net $150/campaign
- Production: Cost $100/unit, Profit $150/unit → Net $50/unit

**Variables:**
- x = number of marketing campaigns
- y = number of production units

**Objective Function (Maximize):**
Profit = 150x + 50y

**Constraint:**
50x + 100y ≤ 10,000
Simplified: x + 2y ≤ 200

**Solution:**
Since marketing has higher net profit per dollar invested ($150/$50 = 3.0 vs $50/$100 = 0.5), we should prioritize marketing campaigns.

**Optimal allocation:**
- Maximum marketing campaigns: x = 200 (when y = 0)
- Cost: 200 × $50 = $10,000
- Total profit: 200 × $150 = $30,000

**Verification:**
If we did mixed allocation (x=100, y=50):
- Cost: 100×$50 + 50×$100 = $10,000
- Profit: 100×$150 + 50×$50 = $17,500

The marketing-only strategy yields $30,000 > $17,500, confirming optimality.
```

## Development and Integration Examples

### Quick Start with Transformers

Here's how to get started with BitNET models using the Hugging Face Transformers library:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

# Load BitNET b1.58 2B model
model_name = "microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Prepare conversation
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the advantages of 1-bit neural networks and their potential impact on AI deployment."}
]

# Generate response
input_text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)

model_inputs = tokenizer([input_text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    repetition_penalty=1.05
)

# Extract and display response
output_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()
response = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```
